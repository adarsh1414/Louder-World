Training Data:
Collect event data from sources like Eventbrite, Meetup, etc. Categorize events into different preferences like music, sports, conferences, etc. You’ll need a large dataset of events labeled with user preferences to train the LLM.

Open Source LLM:
Use an existing open-source language model such as GPT-3, GPT-2, or Rasa for the chatbot. Train the model on your labeled event data to understand user preferences.

User Interaction:
Implement the system to interact with the user via WhatsApp or Telegram. You can use Twilio API (for WhatsApp) or python-telegram-bot for the interaction.
Once a user’s preferences are inputted, the system will suggest relevant events based on past data.

Notification System:
When a matching event occurs in the city, the system should notify the user via WhatsApp/Telegram using their stored preferences.
A scheduler can run every 24 hours to check for new events and send notifications.

Steps for Implementation:

Preprocessing and Categorization:
Scrape events and categorize them based on the type (e.g., concerts, workshops).
Use this data to create a knowledge base for the LLM.

Model Training:
Use a language model like GPT-2 or Rasa to train the system. Fine-tune it to understand event-related queries and match user preferences.
Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for training the model.

User Interaction:
Implement an integration with WhatsApp (via Twilio API) or Telegram (via python-telegram-bot) to allow users to interact with the LLM and receive event recommendations.

Automation:
Use APScheduler to schedule daily checks for new events and notify users accordingly.
